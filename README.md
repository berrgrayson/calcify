# Calcify Scientific Calculator Application

The goal of this project is to design a mobile application that simulates a complete scientific calculator. The application must allow the user to perform simple calculations as well as more advanced scientific calculations. The interface must be clear, intuitive and accessible, while integrating a wide range of features useful to students, engineers, and researchers.

## What the user will be able to do:

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Calculate advanced functions such as powers, square roots, logarithms, exponentials, etc.
- Use trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses) with the ability to work in degrees or radians.
- Manipulate complex numbers and perform operations with them.
- Solve complex mathematical equations and expressions.
- Access a history of calculations performed, with the ability to reuse previous results.
- Calculate percentages, permutations, combinations, and factors.
- Work with common scientific constants like pi (Ï€), e (Euler's constant), etc.
- Add custom features like unit conversions or statistical calculations.
